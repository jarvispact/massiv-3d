# TODO

- transparent textures and colors
- obj loader not compatible anymore (material.indices)
- uniform handling sucks. try a separate class for lights and material to better cache update uniform calls
- add support for multiple viewports
- add normal mapping
- define a clear ecs interface
- try offscreen canvas for smoother rendering
- reuse shader programs (ShaderRegistry ?)
